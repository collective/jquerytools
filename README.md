This version of jQuery Tools is compatible with jQuery 1.7+, 1.9+, 2.0+.

NOTE: This is a fork from: https://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools.
The original repository is abandoned and not jQuery 1.9 compatbile.
The reason for this fork is, that Plone 4 depends on jquerytools but needs newer jQuery versions.
